This year I managed to...

- perform at `improv@CIRMMT <https://www.cirmmt.org/en/events/special/21-feb-2025-improv-at>`__
- present at `colloque Interférences <https://finartcialist.com/colloque-interferences-2025/index.html>`__
- present at the `AFPy in Paris <https://assets4.agendadulibre.org/events/32399>`__
- finish my doctoral exam with success
- work on a immersive room project named the NDA room
- and a few other personal things.

In 2026 I will be working on my PhD thesis proposal and hopefully will make some room for some artsy but non-finartcialist projects... as well as start a paper-based newsletter ? and leave the internet.
