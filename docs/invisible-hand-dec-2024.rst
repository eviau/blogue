I have this ongoing struggle where I want to change the name of my project, but I don't know what to change it for. Every alternative I came up is failing me in subtle or not so subtle ways.

Today I was talking with a friend for hours about my project.

And it was an insightful conversation that led me to consider it in many different directions and point of view.

I've been refering more and more to this project as some version or another of "making tangible the invisible hand of the market", casting its shadow onto something, listening to it, touching it... tasting it ?

I want to write something about this, something lengthier. I have a very long term project keeping me busy at the moment though. We will see.

I kinda want and like to work in private for now ...
